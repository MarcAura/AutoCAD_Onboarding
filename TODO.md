Commands to add:

To change how points display in AutoCAD, use the DDPTYPE command or the Point Style option in the Utilities panel to open the Point Style dialog box. From there, select a new point style from the options, adjust the point size, and choose whether the size is relative to the screen or set in absolute units. Click OK to apply the changes and type REGEN to refresh the view if needed.
